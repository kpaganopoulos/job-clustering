# job-clustering
Workforce Analytics Project
The advent of artificial intelligence, together with the implications it brings to business and consumers alike, have incentivised decision makers within organisations to think about how they can incorporate AI-related technologies within their workforce. 

Even if decision makers have identified such a need, questions about how to do it and its implications are still being debated. Throughout the module, you have read about how ready each country is in terms of incorporating automations (see McKinsey pp 13, 77-90 and 91-121). Also, you have taken a look at how the industry begins to think about the problem. Now, you will be tasked to identify opportunities for automation using a comprehensive dataset of jobs and tasks. 

In this assignment you will use the O*NET dataset. 

Please download the dataset below.

Your first task is to identify jobs that can be automated. To do so, you are advised to think about:

How we define a job
:

What AI-related technologies are useful for
How you identify opportunities to introduce automation.
Once you have identified such opportunities, you should:

Categorise the types of jobs that are going to be automated and think about the similarities and differences amongst them. (As a guide, you can look at the McKinsey report, pages 77-90.) 
Identify the jobs that are the most at risk and the ones that are less at risk of automation. Think about the consequences of efficiency on the organisation, peopleâ€™s jobs and the economy as a whole.
Finally, you should compare your results to the PwC report below. What are your conclusions and what critique would you do to their findings in relations to yours?

You can use whatever methods of coding you would like. Present your conclusions in a report of no more than 3,000 words. 

You will be expected to present to the group on your findings before you submit your final report - see details in 5.2.

By submitting, you certify that the work submitted is your group's own work, except where specifically indicated otherwise.

Upload your output and your report as a zipped file below (one submission per group). Name the file "submission-files.zip".
